This project is a custom Pac-Man–style game built in Python using the Pygame library. It runs in fullscreen and features maze-based movement, collision detection, custom sprite images for the player, enemies, and collectibles, as well as score tracking and a win condition when all coins are collected. Pac-Man (or Mario, depending on the sprite used) is controlled with the arrow keys and cannot pass through walls, and the ghosts follow simple automated movement while also respecting boundaries. The game requires Python 3.8 or higher and the Pygame package, which can be installed with pip install pygame. To run the game, place all required images—mario.png, coin.png, mushroom.png, and optionally background.png—in the same directory as the Python script, then open Command Prompt or PowerShell in that folder and run python your_game_file.py. The repository typically includes a README, the Python game file, and all sprite assets. This project can be expanded with sound effects, menus, improved ghost A.I., animations, or additional levels.
